			<h1>Lifepak&#169; 20e Defibrillator Simulator Test Cases</h1>
			
			<h3>Please read carefully </h3>
			<p>
				You are about to begin the first of 3 cases that will test your knowledge of how to use the defibrillator. As in the Tutorial Cases, each scenario will start with a Case Description. After you read the Case Description, you can close that box and begin working the case. 
Please be advised:


			<ol><br>
				<li>You will see a case score and a clock displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. <b>The clock starts once the Case Description box appears.</b> You will need to begin working the case as quickly as possible to avoid point deductions. Bear in mind some interventions are time critical and failure to perform a task in an appropriate time frame may result in patient harm.</li>
				<li>Help will <b>not</b> be available during the test cases. You are expected to complete the cases on your own.</li>
				<li>When each case is over, you will be prompted to advance to the next test case. </li>
			</ol>
			<i>Good Luck!</i>
